	<p>Troi spends most of her time training her
body and building her strength, partly to fend
off the various predators trying to eat her, but
also because itâ€™s her passion. Her body is a
temple, and she seeks to fortify her temple
with the toughest fighter in the forest. Your
arm will be broken.</p>
