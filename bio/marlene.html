	<p>Marlene grew up in the jungle and moved into
the city when her father died at a young age.
She is widely known for her passion for
women (especially vixens) and her short
temper, having anger management problems.
She also serves as the unofficial bodyguard
of the club, making sure no clients step out of
line with the dancers.</p>
