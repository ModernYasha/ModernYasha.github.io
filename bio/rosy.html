	<p>Rosy works hard at her job at Burger Genius
to support and provide a nurturing
environment for her two children. As much as
she loves them, she’s not above laying down
the law on two unruly brats should they act
out of line. And maybe one day they’ll come
out with shampoo that gets the stench of
french fries out of your hair.</p>
