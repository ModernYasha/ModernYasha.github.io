	<p>In the expansive ecosystem that is the
ocean, Zima made a life for herself doing
whatever it is she wanted whenever she
wanted. Raising herself, she acts on raw
instinct and only has two goalsin mind: filling
her belly and doing something fun. Her lack
of manners and complete disregard for socal
code makes her off-putting to most people,
even other merfolk.</p>
