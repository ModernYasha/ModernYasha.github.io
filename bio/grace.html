	<p>Grace has always been a free spirit, letting
the guiding winds of life take her away. Still
relatively young, she’s picked up several
skills and had held dozens of lovers. The
latest chapter in her life story has her
exploring the limitations of the feline body
in front of dozens of customers every night.
And she’s really good at it.</p>
