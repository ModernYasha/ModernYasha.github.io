	<p>Maddy ran away from home a long time ago,
raising herself on the streets. A
kleptomaniac, her sticky fingers often
prevent her from staying under the radar.
Oddly enough, she loves reading books of all
kinds, but she has a preference for romance
novels, and as a result, her relationship
expectations and views are a bit out there.</p>
