	<p>A true enigma of a woman, not much is
known about Asrael. If it wasn’t required by
law, even her real name would be a mystery.
Still, people usually find her initiallyintimidating
presence to be comforting once
you get used to. There’s another woman out
there who’s sick of being compared to her.
I wonder who she is?</p>
