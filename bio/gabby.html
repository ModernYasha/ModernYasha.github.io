	<p>Officer Tabby is a police officer from a
district different from Liz and Theo. Much
like Liz, she had dreams of protecting the
streets, but once she landed her first job, it
wasnâ€™t what she thought it would be.Less of
a dreamer these days, she let the daily grind
and disrespect of the city wear her down,
and while she still does her job well,
how long will she last?</p>
