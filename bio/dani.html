	<p>Dani ran away from home at a young age,
abadoning her older sister. She spent much
of her time in the forest, growing accustomed
to life there, even becoming a pretty good
hunter. The forest life is a lonely one, though,
and she seeks out someone to fill the hole in
her heart, which led her back into the city.</p>
