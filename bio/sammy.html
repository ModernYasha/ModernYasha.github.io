	<p>It’s not completely Sammy’s fault that he’s
such a screw-up. Being the oldest child, and
having inherited more of his father’s traits
than his other two siblings, people like him
less. And with his mother’s berating words
constantly ringing his ears, he often opts to
go out somewhere and “medicate”. He still
loves his brother Jesse a whole lot...when
he’s not messing with him.</p>
