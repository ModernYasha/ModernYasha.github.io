	<p>Since her mother was often busy, Susan
quickly learned how to fend for herself, being
a bit more mature than most girls her age.As
a result, the bond with her mother is not as
strong as the one Mickey has. At times, Susan
clashes with Rosy as she learns her own role
in life, but itâ€™s safe to say she has a bright
future ahead of her.</p>
