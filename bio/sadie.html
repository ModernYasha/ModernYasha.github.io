	<p>If you ask her mother, Sadie is working at a
data firm a few towns over. Little does she
know, however, that her little girl comes to
Angel’s Paradise every night and fulfills the
fantasies of many clients. A generally nice
girl, rumor has it that she’s not as tolerant of
certain stuff as her co-workers are.</p>
