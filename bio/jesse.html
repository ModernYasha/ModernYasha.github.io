	<p>Jesse is the baby of the family, and it shows.
Without the father being in the picture,he
steps up and helps his mother often.
Although he’s not a child, he can still be
slightly impressionable, his morals not firmly
set in yet. And that’s why his mother doesn’t
like him spending too much time with his
older brother.</p>
