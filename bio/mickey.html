	<p>For being an 8-year-old boy, Mickey shows
a lot of initiative, always figuring out ways
to entertain himself. The world is his playground,
but sometimes his body can’t keep
up with his spirit, often getting injured. Even
though he’s younger, most people think he’s
the older sibling, and he just LOVES to eat that
up.</p>
