	<p>In the expansive ocean, legend tells of a
azure-haired siren who lurks the waters,
rarely appearing above the waters. She
commands all things aquatic and controls
them as ice. Her regal appearance suggests
she might belong to a royal family of sorts.
With how far she wanders from any kingdom,
perhaps she is searching for an adventure.</p>
