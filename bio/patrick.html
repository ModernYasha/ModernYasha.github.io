	<p>Patrick had to mature at an early age to help
take care of his mom. Because she’s mute,
there’s a lot he doesn’t know about her
and himself. He’s surprisingly capable; he
taught himself how to read and write, and
he tries to communicate his mother’s
feelings as well as he can. Kids these days
can learn a lot from him!</p>
