	<p>Myra enjoys the freedom that is being a
pirate. Many people still see her as a child,
though, including Captain Douglas, who often
tries to make her wait on the ship when the
crew gets to work, but that doesnâ€™t stop her
from trying to sneak off. She wants to own
her own pirate crew someday.</p>
