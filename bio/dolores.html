	<p>Dolores is head of the McPhee household.
She, of course, isnâ€™t perfect; she coddles her
son Jesse, her oldest son rarely sees her
loving side, and her daughter may have
inherited some undesirable ideals from her.
One could say, though, that you always know
where you stand with her because of how
frank she can be.</p>
